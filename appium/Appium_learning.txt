Appium:

applied simple test code on "An introduction to Appium Desktop" on youtube provided with no success. The app keep opened and closed repeatedly.
-troubleshoot 1:
download sdk that has the same version with tutorial > to check compatibility between version and testapp file

the problem identified at WebDriverAgent

some other message that maybe lead to error:
Got response with status 200: {"value":"The application under test with bundle id 'io.appium.TestApp' is not running, possibly crashed","sessionId":"83F5F22D-DDCF-4C5E-916B-CAB08B557AFF","status":889}

the problem narrowed down to bundle id > issue that came along with didn't setting xcode properly prior to use appium

error building webdriveragent in xcode

after several troubleshooting, it turned out that platform version has to be on 10.2. Problem solved.

considering xcode usage which drained much memory capacity on mac, appium will be moved to linux
